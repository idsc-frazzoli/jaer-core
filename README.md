# Adaptation of jAER at IDSC-Frazzoli

The repository contains an adaptation of the [original jAER](https://github.com/SensorsINI/jaer) repository which is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1.

## Our motivation

The original jAER repository contains a lot of application code and routines for post-processing of the camera data.
In our adaptation, we have removed most of this non-generic functionality.
The result is closer to a library.

The transition is not yet completed.
We plan to remove even more code to make the runtime as light-weight as possible.
